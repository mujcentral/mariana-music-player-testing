Easter Eggs (Fun stuff)
Make into an executable release -> Host on GitHub
IMPLEMENT QUEUE PLAYING
Currently beta features are switched on by default and cannot be opted out of; Change this...

Run a "related-songs-getter" type function to get similar song to the ones you listen to
and package into a playlist (Mariana's own simple playlist format??
                             or prebuilt playlist formats e.g. m3u etc...)

MIGRATE ENTIRELY TO python-vlc FOR PLAYING SONGS OF ANY KIND(CODEC)...

Timed tagging and commenting withing songs:
    timed tagging/comenting will generate an editable yml file with some custom extension
        (maybe as an srt file??)

MAKE THE STEP-BY-STEP WIZARD FOR INITIAL SETUP A BREEZE... (Already kinda is...?)
    ASK 3 QUESTIONS                         ??? (Do we really need it?)
    TELL 3 THINGS                           ??? (Do we really need it?)
    ASK IF YOU WANT TO START APP NOW...     ??? (Do we really need it?)

Save all recursive file paths from all lib dirs in a libpaths files for quick reload 
Mark unplayable/corrupt song files and exclude them from libpaths
    Exclude the unplayable/corrupt from libpaths.yml "general" heading and shift them to "corrupt"
    These marked files WILL STILL be listed in "all" command but will not be directly searchable using the f[ind] command...
    unless the find command is issued with the extra option "c" (for corrupt)

Blacklisting will exclude the unplayable/corrupt from libpaths.yml "general" heading and shift them to "blacklist"
    These marked files WILL STILL be listed in "all" command but will not be directly searchable using the f[ind] command...
    unless the find command is issued with the extra option "b" (for corrupt)

Favourited files will be moved in libpaths.yml from "general" heading to "blacklist"
    These marked files WILL STILL be listed in "all" command but will not be directly searchable using the f[ind] command...
    unless the find command is issued with the extra option "b" (for corrupt)

Find command will be issuable with the following options:
    c: Show only corrupt/unplayable files
    b: Show only blacklisted files
    a: Show only  files
    t <tag_name>: Show only files with given tag (if multiple tags specified, then all tags mst be present)
    f: Show only favourited files
    

Many Great Visualizers (2D and 3D, color changing, other effects....)
Song Videos from youtube (if available) ... ? (May not be implemented)

Log time taken to load this cli tool on every boot and append data to data/app.yml under the "boot_params" heading

Separate error message if deleted file is attempted to be played
Make a temp folder: create ffmpeg version of wav file to mp3 (named cur_V.wav)??
Tone generator (Play sin/sqaure/sawtooth/triangle waves (ora combination) at a given freq, ADSR and volume)
	Can also be recorded...

Free movies
	Downloadable (if licensed)
	Streamable
	Recommendations Support
	New releases + Actors news (Mostly about recommended movie stars + Major stars...
		... --> Most watched movie stars' news floats to top)

Support artists
	Links to their linktree ... and/or
	Donations Page + Website
	Bandcamp
	Deezer
	Spotify
	YouTube
	Wikipedia

Float search results from favs to another table above the other/non-fav results' table (colour in a different scheme from settings)
Sink search results from blacklist to another table below the other/non-fav results' table if f[ind]\[+bl\] is issued (colour in a different scheme from settings)
Show relative numbering of songs from currently playing song if its present in the search results (colour in a different scheme from settings)
Play a song with last remembered position and applied effects
Record sessions
Take regular auto backups of open sessions and offer to reopen them on next bootup
Set volume to default session volume value defined in settings (default=90)
[online + offline] live feed and time-synced commenting + reactions + emojis (dynamic) + stickers

Data for deleted files should be marked as deleted (can be prompted for later deletion if needed)
Record Main System while playing a certain song, to calculate a user's weighted liking to that song
Depending on the player and system vol, actively prevent setting volume to a value higher than some healthy threshold to avoid ear damage (this is calculated better with a function of replaygain, player volume and system volume)...
    (Show a continuous warning if this is disabled --> warnings themselves may/may not be disableable)

Make player more interactive if the current user's settings allow for it...

Get MFCC data from all lib songs and analyse the moods, genres, bpm (tempo), key (scale), energetics, danceability
    Write the analyzed data into a yml file called lib_analyses.yml in genres/genres folder

Set Artist name if not already mentioned in the metadata
Show lyrics in time sync if available, else show the whole lyrics on html page
    else

Quickly fingerprint audio and reliably find and separately save duplicates...
Give short summaries about user's listening habits
See "what others are listening" feature to show other users' listening habits summaries (if they choose to make it public)

Make a `library` command to display all songs + their info in a tabular form (Like a CLI version of Windows File Explorer, but for sound files only)
Make small GUI display for current song progress
Record command history and logs in "historydump.log" and "generallogs.log" respectively
Allow users to enter a PRIVATE SESSION/MODE (Displayed with a "P" before the prompt arrow) (No history/log is ever saved for priv sessions)
If a queue is requested during a play-queue, then the new queue overrides the play-queue.
In any other case, the new queue/play-queue is appended to the previous

Favouriting/Blacklisting
    fav   ==> show favourited status for currently playing song
    fav ! ==> toggle favourited status for currently playing song
    fav + ==> add currently playing song to favourites
    fav - ==> remove currently playing song from favourites

    fav <num1> [<num2> [<num3> [...]]]   ==> show favourited status for songs at provided indices
    fav + <num1> [<num2> [<num3> [...]]] ==> add songs at provided indices to favourites
    fav - <num1> [<num2> [<num3> [...]]] ==> remove songs at provided indices from favourites

    [blacklist|bl]   ==> show blacklist status for currently playing song
    [blacklist|bl] ! ==> toggle blacklist status for currently playing song
    [blacklist|bl] + ==> add currently playing song to blacklist
    [blacklist|bl] - ==> remove currently playing song from blacklist

    [blacklist|bl] <num1> [<num2> [<num3> [...]]]   ==> show blacklist status for song(s) at provided indices
    [blacklist|bl] + <num1> [<num2> [<num3> [...]]] ==> add song(s) at provided indices to blacklist
    [blacklist|bl] - <num1> [<num2> [<num3> [...]]] ==> remove song(s) at provided indices from blacklist

    f[fav]
    f[bl]
    f[-fav]
    f[+bl]
    f[-fav,+bl] | f[+bl,-fav] -> (No spaces within '[]')
    f[tag1,tag2,-fav] -> (Only songs with atleast one provided tags set AND not in favs)

Blacklisted songs won't be shown in default search results
Blacklisted songs will ask for confirmation before being playing in a queue/individual-song/playlist/etc...

The shuffle command will shuffle the current play-queue
The shuffle command can shuffle the current queue or any of the other requested "named queues" (Beta)
	Syntax:
		shuffle [q name]

Loops will be given preference over queues and play-queues, i.e. if a song is looped from within a queue,
then it will keep looping until the loop is closed. After the loop is closed,
the remaining queued songs will start playing as usual until the queue(s) end(s).
Make it colourful. Make display tasty and colourful with borders and themes!
If opening for the first time, find and save songs with their indices in "library.yml"
For all subsequent loads, use enumerated song paths cached in this file.
For refreshing this list, just type the refresh command and effect will take place immediately

Make an elaborate and heavily organized and detailed settings YAML file and markdown + html documentation.
Get list of available bluetooth + connected audio output devicesâ€¦ and highlight the current one. Define a simple command to view + change output devices
All Songs (`all`) should display in exactly 3 columns (not `library`)
Command to show now-playing/<number> in file explorer
Any and all setting changes should be saved/recorded and loaded on each startup/boot
Any and all settings must refresh and come into effect immediately upon issuing the appropriate command w/o the need for rebooting the player

Stream music directly:
	Create a "temp" directory in the program's main dir
	Convert wav to mp3 using FFMPEG
	Cast using SHOUTcast protocol

If all dirs empty, print no files warning (in the beginning)
Various type of tagging is allowed, e.g.:
	Genre
	Colour
	Custom (List of custom tags will be created, you may choose one or create new)

color code song indices by play freq:
  (Upper limits are excluded in range)
  key:	meaning	  abs(play_count)  rel (%)
    0:  never     0                0%
    1:  least     -                0-4%
    2:  less      4-15             4-10%
    3:  moderate  15-100           10-42%
    4:  more      100-inf          42-80%
    5:  most      -                80-100%

  relative plays (%) = (abs play_count)/(total play_count)*100 %

Music Tagging
  Tag rules and about:
      Are case insensitive (any tag uppercase will be converted to lowercase)
      May or may not have aliases
      Tag names MUST be atleast 4 chars long
      Song tags are listed as their aliases and ntot by full name by default...
      ...but you may change this behaviour in the settings
      Only the first 3 tags will be mentioned (and an ellipsis "..." will be shown if there are more tags associated with the song)
      Song tags will be enlisted only 'ls' command isissued with the "long listing" option...
      ...ls -l...
      ...This command was intentionally made this way to look familiar to linux users for their ease of use
      Tags must be unique
      Tag aliases must also be unique
      Tag must not be one of the preprovided tags
      Tag alias must not be one of the preprovided tag aliases
      Tag alias must be either 2 or 3 chars only
      IF IN CASE you exhaust all possible 2 and 3 letter alias permutations...
      ...you may NOT make any new tag aliases, all successive tags MUST be created without aliases...
      ...and referenced accordingly with their full tag-name
      May have any number of non-consecutive spaces (all non-consecutive spaces will be force-reduced to 1 automatically)...
      ... E.g.:
      ... "hello  world" --> "hello world"
      ... "my sweet  dream  " --> "my sweet dream"
      Tags are searchable (E.g. search all songs with tags "jams" and "emotional" --> /f [jams em])...
      ...Tags can be provided either as aliases or full names
      Tags of a particular song can be listed
      Tag names are editable
      Tags of a particular song are changeable (CRUD supported)
      
  Allow use of preprovided tags such as:
